I'm Yankl (pronounced YAHN-kul), or Jacob (or any other cognate) if you prefer. I'm a mathematician, dynamicist, and optimization engineer on the job market. I build mathematical models and optimization algorithms for engineering challenges. Currently exploring applications in dynamics, control, and computational efficiency.

My latest project is [EvolvingNetwork](github.com/Yankeleh/EvolvingNetwork), available on my Github. It is a Julia library which simulates a dynamically and stochastically evolving global network, and analyzes its connectivity properties.

Previously I was a Visiting Postdoc at the TIFR Mumbai working in the field of holomorphic dynamical systems, and before that I completed my PhD at Stony Brook working under the supervision of [Misha Lyubich](math.stonybrook.edu/~mlyubich). My thesis was titled [One parameters families of Schwarz reflection maps arising from Shabat-Belyi maps.](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/alumni/2024-Jacob-Mazor.pdf)
