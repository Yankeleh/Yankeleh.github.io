I'm Yankl (pronounced YAHN-kul), or Jacob (or any other cognate) if you prefer. I'm a mathematician, data scientist, and ML engineer currently the job market. Right now I am thinking about how to apply ML tools and data visualization to public transit analysis.

Previously I was a Visiting Postdoc at the TIFR Mumbai working in the field of holomorphic dynamical systems, and before that I completed my PhD at Stony Brook working under the supervision of [Misha Lyubich](math.stonybrook.edu/~mlyubich). My thesis was titled [One parameters families of Schwarz reflection maps arising from Shabat-Belyi maps.](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/alumni/2024-Jacob-Mazor.pdf)
