Hi! I'm Yankl, though if you prefer you can call me Jacob, Netzah, Yasha, Yacoub, or any other cognate. I'm a third year math PhD student at Stony Brook university, studying dynamical systems under the supervision of [Misha Lyubich](math.stonybrook.edu/~mlyubich).

In the Summer II term of 2021 I will be teaching MAT514 - Analysis for Teachers II.
