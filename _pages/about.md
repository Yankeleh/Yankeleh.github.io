Hi! I'm Yankl (pronounced YAWN-kul), though if you prefer you can call me Jacob, Netzah, Yasha, Yacoub, or any other cognate. I'm a (fifth year!) math PhD student at Stony Brook university, studying dynamical systems under the supervision of [Misha Lyubich](math.stonybrook.edu/~mlyubich).


If you're looking to reach me, the best way is probably by email. My address is "jacob [DOT] mazor [AT] stonybrook [DOT] edu" (with the appropriate substitutions).
