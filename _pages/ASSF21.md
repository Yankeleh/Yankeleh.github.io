# Analysis Student Seminar - Fall 2021

The Analysis Student Seminar meets on Wednesdays at 4:15 PM. In the Fall semester of 2021 it will be run as a reading seminar, with attendees presenting results and techniques from papers that they have read. This page will be updated with more information and speaker schedules as the semester progresses.
